# G.A.P.E.-Global-Applesoft-Program-Editor-
An Applesoft Program Editor for the Apple II line of computers (written in 1985)

When Apple and Microsoft delivered Applesoft BASIC in 1978, it was a significant upgrade for programmers. 
However, Apple did not seize the opportunity to also deliver a better editor that would improve the experience of writing 
BASIC code for developers. Editing long programs was a challenging task and I believed there was a better way.

That is why I started working on a possible solution, Global Applesoft Program Editor (o G.A.P.E). My intent was to create a 
tool that would solve most of the common issues faced by most programmers.

# G.A.P.E. commands
Control commands
These commands are triggered by simultaneously pressing the CTRL (ConTRol) key and a second one. Control commands can only be invoked when the cursor is blinking on the first column of the screen.

Here is a list of the available control commands along with their associated key.

The DOS commands
These functions provide quick access to common DOS functions. If you need to use other DOS. commands, you will have to do so from the default Applesoft BASIC prompt, after leaving G.A.P.E. (see the Quit command).

CTRL-C: CATALOG
CTRL-D: DELETE
CTRL-L: LOAD
CTRL-S: SAVE

All these commands work exclusively with Drive 1. If you want to work with Drive 2, you need to exit G.A.P.E. (see the QUIT command).
