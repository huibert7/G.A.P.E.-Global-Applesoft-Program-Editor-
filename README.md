# G.A.P.E. (Global Applesoft Program Editor)
An Applesoft Program Editor for the Apple II line of computers (written between 184 and 1985)

When Apple and Microsoft delivered Applesoft BASIC in 1978, it was a significant upgrade for programmers. 
However, Apple did not seize the opportunity to also deliver a better editor that would improve the experience of writing 
BASIC code for developers. Editing long programs was a challenging task and I believed there was a better way.

That is why I started working on a possible solution, Global Applesoft Program Editor (a.k.a. G.A.P.E). My intent was to create a tool that would solve most of the common issues faced by most programmers.

Take a look at the documentation on the project's [wiki](https://github.com/huibert7/G.A.P.E.-Global-Applesoft-Program-Editor-/wiki)
